Question: what year did tut became king?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was Tut?

Intermediate answer: King Tutankhamun is one of the most famous rulers who ever lived. He was born during ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty and ascended to the throne at a young age. Tutankhamun restored the old ways of the kingdom and changed his name to Tutankhamun, which meant the 'living image of Amun.' He ruled for about nine years and was one of the lesser-known pharaohs of his time. The cause of Tutankhamun's death is still a mystery, with theories ranging from murder to disease or an accident. His tomb, discovered in 1922, contained numerous treasures that have provided insights into ancient Egypt and continue to captivate the world. Tutankhamun was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt from the 18th Dynasty. He ascended to the throne around the age of nine and reigned until his death around the age of 18-19. Tutankhamun was known for his reversal of Atenism and his restoration of the traditional cult of Amun. He was one of the few kings worshipped as a deity during his lifetime. Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered in 1922, contained vast opulent wealth and is considered one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all time. He had a complex family lineage, and his mother is believed to be either Nefertiti or Meketaten. Tutankhamun's reign included military campaigns and construction projects, and he made endowments to the priestly orders of important cults. Tutankhamun's health was debated, and recent studies suggest he had bone necrosis, a possible clubfoot, and may have died of complications from a broken leg and malaria. Tutankhamun, also known as King Tut, was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. He is famous for his tomb, which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Tutankhamun's dentition and wardrobe have been studied. There is also research on his family and the cause of his death. Tutankhamun's remains have been examined through CT scans and radiographs. His death has been attributed to a chariot accident. Tutankhamun's tomb contained various treasures and artifacts, including an iron dagger blade believed to be of meteoritic origin. Exhibitions featuring Tutankhamun's artifacts have been held around the world. Tutankhamun was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt. He had the haplogroups YDNA R1b, which originated in western Asia. Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922 by British Egyptologist Howard Carter. The discovery of his tomb received worldwide press coverage and sparked renewed public interest in ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun's mummy was placed on display in his underground tomb in Luxor in 2007. His tomb contained over 5,000 artifacts, including his famous gold mask. There have been rumors of a 'curse of the pharaohs' associated with Tutankhamun's tomb. Tutankhamun's artifacts have been exhibited in various international exhibitions, including the 'King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh' tour in 2019-2022.",So the final answer is: Around 1332 BC

Question: what type of monarchy did england have?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: When did England become a monarchy?

Intermediate answer: England became a monarchy after it was conquered by the Normans in 1066. The tradition of monarchy was broken from 1649 to 1660 during the republican Commonwealth of England. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, a constitutional monarchy was established with power shifting to Parliament. England became a monarchy in 1042 under the rule of Harthacnut, who ruled until his death in 1042. Edward the Confessor further solidified the monarchy and built Westminster Palace and Westminster Abbey. The Norman Conquest in 1066 established the House of Normandy as the ruling monarchy in England. The Plantagenets took over in 1154, with Henry II founding the Angevin Empire. The monarchy continued with various kings, including Richard the Lionheart and Henry V. The Tudor dynasty began with Henry VII in 1485, followed by his son Henry VIII, who established the Church of England. The Stuart dynasty followed, and the monarchy continued to evolve throughout history. England became a monarchy after the Union of the Crowns in 1603 when James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I. The monarchy was restored in 1660 after the overthrow of the English monarchy. England and Scotland were united as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 under Queen Anne. England became a monarchy in the 10th century after the consolidation of the petty kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England and early medieval Scotland. It was conquered by the Normans in 1066. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain.","So the final answer is: England became a monarchy in the 10th century after the consolidation of the petty kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England and early medieval Scotland.

Follow up: What is the official language of Brazil?

Intermediate answer: Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the primary language used in most schools and media. The official language of Brazil is Portuguese.
Follow up: Is there any other language spoken in Brazil?

Intermediate answer: The official language spoken in Brazil is Portuguese. However, there are also other languages spoken in Brazil, such as German, indigenous languages, and some knowledge of Spanish and English. Other languages such as Polish and Ukrainian, along with German and Italian, are spoken in rural areas of Southern Brazil, by small communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual. There are whole regions in southern Brazil where people speak both Portuguese and one or more of these languages. For example, Hunsrik, or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, has around 3,000,000 native speakers in Brazil, while also having some speakers in Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela. The language is most used in the countryside of the South Region states of Brazil, with a considerable amount of native speakers using it as their main or even only language. Some immigrant communities in southern Brazil, chiefly the German and the Italian ones, have lasted long enough to develop distinctive dialects from their original European sources. For example, Brazilian German, a broad category which includes the Hunsrik language, but also East Pomerian and Plautndense, based on the Venetian language. Other German dialects were transplanted to this part of Brazil. For example, the Austrian dialect spoken in Dreizehnlinden or Treze Tílias in the state of Paraná; or the East Pomeranian dialect spoken in many different parts of southern Brazil (in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, etc.). Meanwhile, on the Argentinian and Uruguayan border regions, Brazilian students are being introduced to the Spanish language. Asian languages such as Chinese, Hakka, Mandarin, and Cantonese are spoken by some Chinese communities, especially from Macau. Japanese is also spoken in Brazil, with a large community of Japanese descendants numbering about 1.5 million people. Spanish is understood to various degrees by many but not all Brazilians, due to the similarities between Portuguese and Spanish. In some parts of Brazil, close to the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians will use a rough mixture known as Portuñol to communicate with their neighbors on the other side of the border; however, these Brazilians continue to speak Portuguese at home. Bilingualism is common in German colonies in Southern Brazil. There are also indigenous languages spoken throughout Brazil, mostly in Northern Brazil. Portuguese is the official and national language of Brazil. However, there are also numerous minority languages spoken in Brazil, including indigenous languages such as Nheengatu (a descendant of Tupi) and languages of European and Asian immigrants such as Italian, German, and Japanese. Some municipalities have official status for these minority languages. Additionally, there are approximately 217 indigenous languages spoken in Brazil, along with other non-indigenous languages. Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) is the official language of the Brazilian deaf community. The population of Brazil speaks or signs 238 languages, with approximately 217 being indigenous. According to the president of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), there are an estimated 210 languages spoken in Brazil. 154 are Amerindian languages, while the others are languages brought by immigrants. The first municipality to co-officialize other languages alongside Portuguese was São Gabriel da Cachoeira, with the languages Nheengatu, Tukano, and Baniwa. German was the most widely spoken language in Brazil after Portuguese, according to the 1940 census. Italian immigration to Brazil was significant, but German had more speakers. Other languages such as Polish, Ukrainian, Spanish, and various indigenous languages are also spoken in Brazil. Portuguese, German, Indigenous languages, Spanish, English, Italian",", Polish, Ukrainian, and various other languages are spoken in Brazil.
So the final answer is: Portuguese"

Question: what would have happened if germany had won ww1?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.

Intermediate answer: Germany's goals in WW1 were to weaken France, build an empire in Europe, become a colonial power, and potentially become the dominant power in Europe.
Follow up: How would Germany have achieved these goals if they had won WW1?

Intermediate answer: Germany's possible defeat of Britain in 1940 is by some distance the national treasure trove of might-have-been the two – and no one can say which would have won in the end. But one can say that a victorious Germany, imposing peace on the defeated allies at the treaty of Potsdam, would not have had the reparations. In that case, neither the Holocaust nor the second world war would necessarily have followed. If Germany's Jews had survived, Zionism might not have had the international moral force that it rightly claims in 1918. In the kaiser's Europe, defeated France would be the more likely seedbed for fascism, not Germany. But with its steel and coal still in German-controlled Alsace-Lorraine, France's military and naval forces would have been weakened. The British empire would have been without a prince. Meanwhile America, whose entry into the war would have been successfully pre-empted by Germany's victory, would have become a firmly isolationist power and not the enforcer of international order. The Soviet Union, with a wary but powerful neighbor in victorious Germany, would have been the great destabilizing factor but it might not have been invaded as it was in 1941.","So the final answer is: Germany would have achieved its goals of weakening France, building an empire in Europe, becoming a colonial power, and potentially becoming the dominant power in Europe, but the Holocaust and the second world war would not necessarily have followed."

Under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union transformed from an agrarian society to an industrial and military superpower. Stalin implemented Five-Year Plans to spur economic growth and collectivize agriculture. The Soviet Union was involved in the Cold War with the United States and Great Britain, and the alliance between them began to crumble after World War II. Nikita Khrushchev succeeded Stalin and implemented de-Stalinization policies. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 due to factors such as economic issues, independence movements, and a failed coup by Communist Party hard-liners. The Soviet Union was a communist state that existed from 1922 to 1991. It was governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and had a power hierarchy consisting of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of Ministers, and the Communist Party. The Soviet Union had a command economy and was known for its military strength, space program, and significant growth in science and technology. However, it also had limited human rights, a lack of political freedom, and was involved in the Cold War with the United States.","The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, leading to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
So the final answer is: The Soviet Union was a communist state that existed from 1922 to 1991."

Question: who speaks farsi?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: What language is Farsi?

Intermediate answer: Farsi is the Persian language. It is the official language of Iran and is descended from Old Persian and Middle Persian. Farsi has influenced other languages such as Kurdish, Balochi, Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Ottoman Turkish, Georgian, Arabic, and Dravidian languages. It has also borrowed words from Arabic and Parthian. The Persian language has a rich literary tradition and is similar to many contemporary European languages in terms of grammar. The Persian language was the official language of Iran during the Sassanid dynasty, but after the Arab conquest, Arabic became dominant. The Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the Tajik language in the late 1930s, replacing the Latin alphabet. Persian is the lingua franca of Iran and is used in official documents, correspondence, and textbooks. Farsi is the Western Iranian language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian subdivision of the Indo-European languages. It is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Farsi is known for its grammar, which is similar to that of many European languages. Throughout history, Persian was considered prestigious by various empires and influenced languages spoken in neighboring regions and beyond. It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. The language has evolved over time, with Old Persian being attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions, Middle Persian being used during the Sassanid era, and New Persian emerging in the 9th century. Classical Persian refers to the standardized language of medieval Persia used in literature and poetry. Persian has also had a significant influence on languages in South Asia, such as Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi, Kashmiri, and Bengali. Farsi is a language spoken in Iran, and by minorities in Iraq and the Persian Gulf states. Farsi is the official language of Iran. It is also known as Persian and belongs to the Western Iranian language family. The term 'Farsi' is the Persian word for the Persian language and has been used widely in English. However, the Academy of Persian Language and Literature prefers the use of 'Persian' in foreign languages. The standard Persian of Iran is also referred to as Iranian Persian and Western Persian.","So the final answer is: Farsi is spoken in Iran, and by minorities in Iraq and the Persian Gulf states."

Follow up: When was Neptune discovered?

Intermediate answer: Neptune was discovered in September 1846 through mathematically-predicted observation. It was first observed at the New Berlin Observatory at Linden Street. The discovery of Neptune led to the discovery of its moon, Triton, just seventeen days later. Earlier observations of Neptune were made by Galileo in 1612 and 1613. Pre-discovery observations of Neptune were important in accurately determining its orbit. The discovery telescope used to observe Neptune was an achromatic refractor with an aperture of 9 Paris inches. Neptune was discovered just after midnight, after less than an hour of searching and less than 1 degree from the predicted position. It was mathematically predicted before it was directly observed. The discovery of Neptune confirmed Newtonian gravitational theory. The planet was discovered observationally at the New Berlin Observatory. John Herschel almost discovered Neptune in a similar way to how his father discovered Uranus. There was evidence suggesting that Galileo may have been aware of something unusual about Neptune. The discovery telescope at the New Berlin Observatory was an achromatic refractor with an aperture of 9 Paris inches.",So the final answer is: Neptune was discovered in September 1846 through mathematically-predicted observation at the New Berlin Observatory by Johann Gottfried Galle.

Follow up: What are the gods in Buddhism?

Intermediate answer: Devas, asuras, yakshas, nats, kami, bodhisattvas, Vairocana, Dharmakaya, Tara, Vajrayogini, Guan Yu, Hachiman, Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, tulkus, dharma protectors, Wisdom Kings, Twenty-Four Protective Devas, Maheśvara, Brahma, Śakra, Chakrasamvara, yidam, Asuras, yakshas, nats Buddhism is sometimes called an 'atheistic' religion, although some of us prefer 'non-theistic'--meaning that there are all kinds of god-like creatures and beings called devas populating the early scriptures of Buddhism. Vajrayana Buddhism still makes use of tantric deities in its esoteric practices. Buddhist Vajrayana is based on Mahayana Buddhist teaching. In Mahayana Buddhism, no phenomena have objective or independent existence. Iconic beings such as Avalokiteshvara are evoked to bring compassion to the world, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the God of monotheism, as commonly understood, can be dropped seamlessly into Buddhism. The creation of phenomena is taken care of by a concept called Dependent Origination. The consequences of our actions are accounted for by karma, which in Buddhism is also a kind of natural law that doesn't require a supernatural cosmic judge. The question as to whether there are or are not gods in Buddhism can't really be answered with a yes or no. Merely believing in Buddhist deities is a personal choice.","So the final answer is: Devas, asuras, yakshas, nats, kami, bodhisattvas, Vairocana, Dharmakaya, Tara, Vajrayogini, Guan Yu, Hachiman, Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, tulkus, dharma protectors, Wisdom Kings, Twenty-Four Protective Devas, Maheśvara, Brahma, Śakra, Chakrasamvara, yidam, Asuras, yakshas, nats."

Intermediate answer: The Glorious Revolution, also called 'The Revolution of 1688' and 'The Bloodless Revolution,' took place from 1688 to 1689 in England.

Question: what government system does north korea have?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: What type of government does North Korea have?

Intermediate answer: North Korea has a classless society, but a new privileged elite of high-ranking military and government officials has emerged. The country's overall standard of living and the lot of the peasants have improved since World War II. North Korea has a national grain-rationing system that has collapsed, leading to food shortages and forcing many North Koreans to search for food. The country has a total of 12 years of primary and secondary education. The Workers' Party of Korea opposes accommodation and economic reform of any type. North Korea has a national government dominated by the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). The government consists of three branches: administrative, legislative, and judicial. The Cabinet is the administrative and executive body, headed by the Premier. The government is confirmed by the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA). The President of the SPA is the titular head of state, but the government is under one-man leadership. North Korea is an authoritarian regime and has an ideological party, the WPK, which views itself as the defender of the revolutionary worldview. The State Affairs Commission replaced the National Defense Commission as the highest government entity. The judiciary is headed by the Central Court, but the judiciary is not independent and does not acknowledge individual rights. North Korea is divided administratively into nine provinces and has a system of local people's committees under the control of the central government. The government has a strong military focus and prioritizes the military as the guardian of its accomplishments and power. North Korea has a history of nuclear ambitions and has conducted several nuclear tests.","So the final answer is: North Korea has an authoritarian regime with a national government dominated by the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). The government consists of three branches: administrative, legislative, and judicial. The judiciary is not independent and does not acknowledge individual rights.

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: What is the definition of Eastern Europe?

Intermediate answer: Central and Eastern Europe is a geopolitical term encompassing the countries in the Baltics, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe. The term 'Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs)' is used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for a group of countries including Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Eastern Europe stretches from the Ural Mountains in the east to the borders of Poland and Romania. Most definitions include the countries of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The term 'Eastern Europe' was created during the Cold War and was synonymous with communist states. There are multiple definitions of Eastern Europe, and they often lack precision and may be anachronistic. The idea of Eastern Europe is constantly being redefined. The term is sometimes considered pejorative and stereotypes about Eastern Europe being inferior to Western Europe exist. Eastern Europe has historically been defined by the traditions of the Slavs and Greeks. The boundaries of Eastern Europe are subject to historical fluctuations and can be difficult to define precisely. The South Caucasus nations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are sometimes included in definitions of Eastern Europe. Some European republics of the former Soviet Union, such as Belarus and Moldova, are considered part of Eastern Europe. Historians and social scientists generally view some definitions of Eastern Europe as outdated or relegated.","So the final answer is: Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia."

Follow up: Where did the earthquake occur?

Intermediate answer: Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines, such as the Circum-Pacific Belt and the Alpide earthquake belt. The world's greatest earthquake belt, the circum-Pacific seismic belt, is found along the rim of the Pacific Ocean. The Alpide earthquake belt extends from Java to Sumatra through the Himalayas, the Mediterranean, and out into the Atlantic. Iceland, which sits directly over the mid-Atlantic Ridge, has also experienced earthquakes. Florida and North Dakota are the states with the fewest earthquakes. Antarctica has the least earthquakes of any continent. California has more earthquakes that cause damage than any other state. Japan has the most earthquakes due to its active seismic area and dense seismic network. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures) and within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicenters and volcanoes. Earthquakes can strike any location at any time, but history shows they occur in the same general patterns year after year, principally in three large zones of the earth: around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, where about 81 percent of our planet's largest earthquakes occur (known as the Ring of Fire); along plate boundaries; and in areas where strains in rock masses have accumulated to a point where the resulting stresses exceed the strength of the rocks.","The 2010 Chile earthquake occurred off the coast of central Chile, near the city of Concepción.
So the final answer is: Off the coast of central Chile, near the city of Concepción."

Question: where did vietnam originate?
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: What is the origin of Vietnam?

Intermediate answer: The origin of Vietnam can be traced back to the Hoabinhians, who were the true original inhabitants. However, present-day central and southern coastal Vietnam from around the 2nd century AD are of Austronesian origin. The southernmost sector of modern Vietnam, the Mekong Delta and its surroundings, was until the 18th century influenced by the Khmer kingdom. The early peoples of Vietnam were skilled agriculturalists, growing rice and keeping buffaloes and pigs. The first mo---dern humans to arrive and settle in the area of modern-day Vietnam are known as the Hoabinhians, who can be traced as the ancestors of modern-day Negritos. Archae---ydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to repel invaders, led to the creation of the first legendary Vietnamese states approximately 2879 BC. While in the later times, ongoing research from archaeologists h---as suggested that the Vietnamese Đông Sơn culture were traceable back to Northern Vietnam, Guangxi, and Laos around 700 BC. Vietnam's origin can be traced back to the Trưng Sisters, who are revered as the national symbol of Vietnamese women. The Vietnamese elites were educated in Chinese culture and politics during the Second Chinese domination. Shi Xie ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was considered 'the first Vietnamese.' There were successful revolts by the Cham nations in Central Vietnam. The Vietnamese gained independence in 938 under the leadership of Ngô Quyền. Vietnam went through various dynasties, including the Lý dynasty, Trần dynasty, and Later Lê dynasty. Vietnam was under Chinese domination during the Fourth Chinese domination from 1407 to 1427. Lê Lợi reestablished independence and founded the Lê dynasty in 1428. Vietnam was divided between the northern Mac dynasty and the southern Lê dynasty from 1533 to 1592. The Trịnh lords and Nguyễn lords were prominent during this period. Japan had trade and diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the late 16th century. The origin of Vietnam can be traced back to the early exposure of Annam and Annamese to Westerners, the development of the Vietnamese romanized alphabet in 1651, the establishment of trading posts by Europeans, the influence of missionaries, the Tây Sơn army commanded by Nguyễn Huệ, the involvement of the French colonial empire in the 19th century, the division and modern period, the Republican era, the Vietnam War, and the reunification of Vietnam. The origin of Vietnam is a topic covered in the scraped text. However, the relevant information is not provided in the given text. The origin of Vietnam is traced back to the Vietnamese communist government after the Fall of Saigon. Between 1975 and 1980, more than 1 million northerners migrated to the south and central regions formerly under the Republic of Vietnam. This program displaced around 750,000 to over 1 million Southerners from their homes. Additionally, Vietnam faced challenges from Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime, which led to the invasion of Cambodia by the PAVN in 1978. China also sent troops into Northern Vietnam in 1979. Vietnam's international isolation extended to relations with the United States, and the trade embargo imposed on Vietnam was enforced as long as Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia. Vietnam received economic and military aid from the Soviet Union throughout the 1980s. After President Bill Clinton visited Vietnam in 2000, a new era of Vietnam began, and it has become an increasingly attractive destination for economic development. Vietnam also faces disputes, mostly with Cambodia over their shared border and the South China Sea. In 2016, President Barack Obama became the 3rd U.S. Head of State to visit Vietnam, which helped to normalize relations with Vietnam.","So the final answer is: The origin of Vietnam can be traced back to the Hoabinhians, who were the true original inhabitants.
